# Wizards Chemistry Dashboard 🏀

An interactive lineup-chemistry and decision-support dashboard built to explore:
- Which lineups actually work
- Which combinations are stable vs volatile
- How individual players impact lineup chemistry
- What lineups to trust in high-leverage moments

Built with **Python, Dash, Plotly**, and lineup-level NBA data.

## 🔍 What this app does

### Lineups Tab
- Visualizes chemistry (NET rating) vs usage (minutes)
- Flags lineups to **expand**, **test**, or **reduce**
- Shows top teammate combinations given selected players

### Players Tab
- Best 5-man builds around a selected player
- Player chemistry fingerprint (who they play best with)
- Worst chemistry pairings (avoid lists)
- Crunch-time lineup recommendation engine

### Trends Tab
- Chemistry momentum (is it getting better or worse?)
- Stability vs upside analysis
- Player on/off chemistry impact

### Synergy Map
- Network graph of player-to-player chemistry
- Edge thickness = minutes together
- Color = chemistry strength

## 🧠 Why this matters

This dashboard is designed to feel less like “analytics for analytics’ sake” and more like:
> **“What should we try next — and what should we avoid?”**

It’s meant to support rotation decisions, lineup experimentation, and film review.
